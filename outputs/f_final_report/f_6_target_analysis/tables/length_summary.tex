\paragraph*{Activity length (token counts).} Across the 96 activities, the median sentence length is 4.0 tokens (mean 4.7, IQR 3.0–7.0, range 2–12). By target, medians are: Investigative (T10) 4.0, Social (T12) 4.0, Language\,\&\,Culture (T1) 4.0, Food\,\&\,Hospitality (T8) 4.0. Correlations between length and absolute score are modest overall (r=-0.09) and per target (e.g., T10 r=-0.12, T12 r=0.06, T1 r=-0.16, T8 r=-0.28), indicating that while sentences are short, length alone does not drive difficulty. Instead, short inputs limit contextual disambiguation, which—combined with construct overlap and label dispersion—helps explain higher RRMSE for targets like Investigative.
